## What is an API

- An application program interface (API) is a set of routines, protocols, and tools for building software applications.- Basically, an API specifies how software components should interact.
- APIs are used when programming graphical user interface (GUI) components.
- A resource that explaines APIs in plain simple language can be found [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-an-api-in-english-please-b880a3214a82/)

### Types of API

- There are many different types of APIs for operating systems, applications or websites
- APIs are also specified by websites. For example, Amazon or eBay APIs allow developers to use the existing retail infrastructure to create specialized web stores

## What Is a REST API?

- REST is an acronym for Representational State Transfer
- A REST API is a way for two computer systems to communicate using the HTTP technologies found in web browsers and servers.
- REST was defined in 2000 by Roy Fielding and is considerably simpler than other communication standars
- It provides a set of recommendations such as
  - **Client-server**: SystemA makes an HTTP request to a URL hosted by SystemB, which returns a response
  - **Stateless**: REST is stateless: the client request should contain all the information necessary to respond.
  - **Cacheable**: A response should be defined as cacheable or not.
  - **Layered**: The requesting client need not know whether it’s communicating with the actual server, a proxy, or any other intermediary.

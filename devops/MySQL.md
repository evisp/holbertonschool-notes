# Database Administration and MySQL

## What is a database

- A database is information that is set up for easy access, management and updating
- Databases are used for storing, maintaining and accessing any sort of data

### Types of Databases

- **Relational**:
  - Relational databases are comprised of tables.
  - Data is placed into predefined categories in those tables.
  - Each table has columns with at least one data category, and rows that have a certain data instance for the categories which are defined in the columns.
  - Relational databases use SQL

- **Distributed**
  - This database stores records or files in several physical locations.
  - Data processing is also spread out and replicated across different parts of the network.

- **Cloud**
  - These databases are built in a public, private or hybrid cloud for a virtualized environment
  - These databases can work with applications deployed as software as a service

- **NoSQL**
  - NoSQL databases are good when dealing with large collections of distributed data.
  - They can address big data performance issues better than relational databases.
  - They also do well analyzing large unstructured data sets

- **Object-Oriented**
  - These databases hold data created using object-oriented programming languages.
  - They focus on organizing objects rather than actions and data rather than logic.

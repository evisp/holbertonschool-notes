# Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

- Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is an HTTP-header based mechanism that allows a server to indicate any origins (domain, scheme, or port) other than its own from which a browser should permit loading resources
- The CORS mechanism supports secure cross-origin requests and data transfers between browsers and servers.

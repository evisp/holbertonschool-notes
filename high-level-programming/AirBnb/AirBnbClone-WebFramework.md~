# AirBnB clone - Web framework

## What is a web framework

- A web framework is a software framework that is designed to support the development of web applications including web services, web resources and web API
- frameworks offer a set of features that you can use to create a custom application

### Types of Web frameworks

- **Server-side Frameworks**
  - The rules and architecture of the server-side frameworks permit you to create simple pages, landings and forms of different kinds.
  - Server-side frameworks handle HTTP requests, database control and management, URL mapping, etc
   - Example: `.NET, Django (Python), Express (JavaScript)`
- **Client-side Frameworks**
  - They function inside the browser. Therefore, you can enhance and implement new user interfaces
  - Examples: `Angular, React.js, Vue.js`

### Web application framework- Architecture

- Most of the web frameworks depend on the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture.
  - The Model comprises of all the data, business logic layers, its guidelines and functions
  - The View is for the graphical representation of the data like graph or charts etc. It is the appsâ€™ front-end
  - The Controller translates the input data into the scope of commands of the previous ones

## A Minimal Application with Flask

- A minimal Flask application looks something like this:

```Python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def hello_world():
    return "<p>Hello, World!</p>"
```

### HTML Escaping

- When returning HTML, any user-provided values rendered in the output must be escaped to protect from injection attacks
- HTML templates rendered with Jinja, will do this automatically.

```Python
from markupsafe import escape

@app.route("/<name>")
def hello(name):
    return f"Hello, {escape(name)}!"
```

### Routing

- Modern web applications use meaningful URLs to help users.
- Use the `route()` decorator to bind a function to a URL.

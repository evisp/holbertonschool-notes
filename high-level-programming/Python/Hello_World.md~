# Python - Hello World

### Why Python programming is awesome

- Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Python’s elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.
- Python allows you to split your program into modules that can be reused in other Python programs. It comes with a large collection of standard modules that you can use as the basis of your programs 


### Who created Python

- Guido van Rossum

### Where does the name ‘`Python`’ come from

- The language is named after the BBC show “Monty Python’s Flying Circus” and has nothing to do with reptiles

### What is the Zen of Python

- The Zen of Python is a collection of 19 "guiding principles" for writing computer programs that influence the design of the Python programming language.

### How to use the Python interpreter

- Python is an interpreted language; no compilation and linking is necessary.

### How to print text and variables using `print`

- One can call the `print` method. Formatting can be done using `printf` style or string formatting through `f-string`

### How to use strings

- Strings are denoted in single, double or triple quotes. Special characters can be escaped using \ or simply by enclosing them within quotes. 
- Strings can be concatenated using `+`, or multiplied using `*`
- Strings can be used as arrays, i.e., indexing them starting at position `0`
- Python strings cannot be changed, they are immutable


### What are indexing and slicing in Python

- A string can be indexed from `0` to `len - 1` where `len` is the length of the strings. E.g `word = “Python”`; `word[0] = ‘P’`; `word[5] = ‘n’`
- Negative indexing can also be used. E.g `word[-1] = ‘n’`

### What is the official Python coding style and how to check your code with `pycodestyle` 

- `pycodestyle` is a tool to check your Python code against some of the style conventions

# HTML - elements of a web page

## Doctype

- The `doctype` is necessary at the top of every HTML page to force the browser to render the page according to relevant specifications.
-  `<!DOCTYPE html>` is required at the top of each page. Its goal is to prevent a browser from switching into so-called *"quirks mode"* when rendering a document

## The `<head>` element

- Below are the essential elements for any web document (websites/apps):

```html
<meta charset="utf-8">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
<title>Page Title</title>
```
- Valid `<head>` elements include `meta`, `link`, `title`, `style`, `script`, `noscript`, and `base`
- These elements provide information for how a document should be perceived, and rendered, by web technologies. e.g. browsers, search engines, bots, etc.

# Linear Algebra

## What is a vector?
- *Physics*: a quantity having direction as well as magnitude (arrows in space)
- *Computer Science*: ordered lists of numbers

## What is a matrix?
- A matrix is a compact but general way to represent any linear transform
- Examples of linear transforms are rotations, scalings, projections
- An `m` by `n`  matrix is a function of two variables, the first of which has domain `{1,2,…,m}`
 and the second of which has domain `{1,2,…,n}`

## What is a transpose?
- the transpose of a matrix is an operator which flips a matrix over its diagonal; that is, it switches the row and column indices of the matrix

## What is the shape of a matrix?
- The shape of a matrix refers to the number of elements in each dimension

## What is an axis?
- the axis represents the dimension of the data

## What is a slice?
- Slicing means taking elements from one given index to another given index

## How do you slice a vector/matrix?
- We pass slice instead of index like this: `[start:end]`.
- We can also define the step, like this: `[start:end:step]`

## What are element-wise operations?
- Arithmetic operations between multiple Numpy arrays are applied in an element-wise way
- Most arithmetic operations are supported by using either the standard operators or NumPy functions
- In python: `numpy.add(), numpy.substract(), numpy.divide(), numpy.multiply()`

## How do you concatenate vectors/matrices?
- 


## What is the dot product?
## What is matrix multiplication?
## What is Numpy?
## What is parallelization and why is it important?
## What is broadcasting?

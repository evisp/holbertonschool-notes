# C - Function Pointers

## Function pointers

### ** Learning Objectives **

### What are function pointers and how to use them
- In C, we can have pointers to functions
- Unlike normal pointers, we do not allocate / deallocate memory using function pointers.
- A function’s name can also be used to get functions’ address
- Like normal pointers, we can have an array of function pointers
- Function pointer can be used in place of switch case 
- Like normal data pointers, a function pointer can be passed as an argument and can also be returned from a function.

### What does a function pointer exactly hold
- Unlike normal pointers, a function pointer points to code, not data. Typically a function pointer stores the start of executable code.

### Where does a function pointer point to in the virtual memory

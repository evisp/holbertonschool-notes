# Variables, If, Else, While

## Variables, if, else, why

### What are the arithmetic operators and how to use them

- `+` adds two operands
- `-` subtracts second operand from first
- `*` multiplies both
- `/` divides numerator by denominator
- `%` modulus operator (remainder after division)
- `++` and `--` increment and decrement

### What are the logical operators (sometimes called boolean operators) and how to use them
- `&&` (AND) it returns true if both conditions are true
- `||` (OR) returns true if either of the conditions is true
- `!` (NOT) reverses the state of operators

###What the the relational operators and how to use them
- `==` checks if both values are equal
- `!=` checks if values are different
- `>` and `<` check if a value is larger or smaller than another
- `>=` and `<=` respectively check if a value is greater or equal to the other `/` smaller or equal to the other

### What values are considered TRUE and FALSE in C
- 1 and 0

### What are the boolean operators and how to use them
- TRUE and FALSE values that can be combined using logical operators

### How to use the if, if ... else statements
- If a condition is true, then execute the code for that condition
- Else, execute the code in case the above condition is false

### How to use comments
- Use comments wisely to describe what specific parts of the code are doing

###How to declare variables of types char, int, unsigned int 
- **type variable_name**

### How to assign values to variables
- **variable_name = variable_value;**

### How to print the values of variables of type char, int, unsigned int with printf 
- **printf(“format”, arguments)** where we can use %d %c for numbers and characters and then provide the arguments

### How to use the while loop
- while (condition) {...blocks of code…}

### How to use variables with the while loop
- Variables can be used as part of the condition, but also within the block of statements

### How to print variables using printf
- **printf(“format”, arguments)** where we can use %d %c for numbers and characters and then provide the arguments

### What is the ASCII character set
- American Standard Code for Information Exchange

### What are the purpose of the gcc flags -m32 and -m64 
- To compile 32 and 64 bit objects
